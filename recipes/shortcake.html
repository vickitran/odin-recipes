      The vegan shortcakes are tender and fluffy, with a hint of sweetness that
      perfectly balances out the tartness of the fresh strawberries. The
      strawberries themselves are perfectly ripe and bursting with flavor, and
      the addition of a sprinkle of sugar before layering them onto the
      shortcakes really brings out their natural sweetness. The vegan whipped
      cream is a lovely finishing touch, adding a creamy richness that ties
      everything together. Overall, this is a vegan strawberry shortcake that
      truly stands out and is not to be missed.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vegan butter, cold and cut into small pieces</li>
    <li>3/4 cup unsweetened plant-based milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 pint fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced</li>
    <li>Additional sugar, for sprinkling on strawberries</li>
    <li>Vegan whipped cream, for serving (optional)</li>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, and
        salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut in the cold vegan butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until
        the mixture resembles coarse sand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the plant-based milk and vanilla extract, and stir until the dough
        comes together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and gently knead it a
        few times until it is smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat the dough out into a circle that is about 1 inch thick. Use a
        biscuit cutter or a glass to cut out rounds of dough. You should get
        about 6 shortcakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the shortcakes on a baking sheet and bake for 12-15 minutes, or
        until they are lightly golden.
      </li>
      <li>Remove the shortcakes from the oven and let them cool slightly.</li>
      <li>
        While the shortcakes are cooling, toss the sliced strawberries with a
        sprinkle of sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble the shortcakes, split each shortcake in half horizontally.
        Place the bottom half on a plate, top with a spoonful of sugared
        strawberries and a dollop of vegan whipped cream, if using. Add the top
        half of the shortcake, and repeat with the remaining shortcakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the shortcakes immediately, or store them in an airtight container
        in the fridge for up to 3 days. Enjoy!
      </li>
